# 📌 FdF – 3D Wireframe Map Visualization

***📝 Description***

This project is a 3D wireframe map visualizer, developed as part of the 42 School curriculum.

It focuses on graphics programming, mathematical transformations, and performance optimization using MiniLibX.

*Additionally, this project integrates seamlessly with:*

📜 [Libft](https://github.com/gaspardboidin/Libft) – A custom C standard library.

📄 [Get Next Line](https://github.com/gaspardboidin/Get_Next_Line) – A function that reads a file line by line.

***🚀 Features***

✅ Loads and renders 3D wireframe maps from .fdf files.

✅ Zooming and translation support for better navigation.

✅ Rotation along different axes for full 3D visualization.

✅ Dynamic color management for enhanced visual appeal.

✅ Keyboard controls for intuitive interaction.

✅ Optimized performance using efficient rendering techniques.

***⚙️ Compilation & Usage***


    make
*This generates the fdf executable.*

***⚙️ Run the program***



    ./fdf maps/42.fdf
*(Replace sample.fdf with your own map file.)*

***📌 Control***

- W A S D → Move the map *(when zoomed in)*.
- '+' '-' → Zoom in and out.
- Arrow Keys & Q & E → Adjust the altitude dynamically.
- R G B C → Change the wireframe color.
- P → Change projection type.
- ESC → Exit the program.

***🎯 Skills Developed***


✔️ Graphics programming with MiniLibX.

✔️ Mathematical transformations for 3D rendering.

✔️ Optimized line drawing algorithms (Bresenham’s Algorithm).

✔️ Memory management and structured file parsing.

✔️ Handling user input for real-time interaction.
